### Surface
Colors <br>
I developed a color palette using Coolors. I started out with a softer palette but then the background image I found inspired the choice of hot pink. The strong, eye-catching color, grounded by soft dark brown, is a good representation of my personal brand. <br>

Fonts <br>
I used Google Fonts and chose a rounded, modern sans serif font that is easy to read. <br>

Images <br>
I used Unsplash to find and download the main background image. The colorful pencils are playful, and represent a toolbox of options and a tactile approach. <br>
